# Introduction
<p>
It was certainly a long journey, but now that I am finished with my time at SNHU I can reflect on my growth, both as a software developer and modern and as a life-long learner. I originally began at SNHU as a criminal Justice major. After taking a few classes I began to realize that this career path was not for me. I had always had great interest in technology and growing up I spent a lot of time tinkering with anything I could get my hands on. I had drifted away from this interest in the first few years of my adult life but as I began to search for new career options my love of technology and computers came back. I thought back on taking an introduction to webpage design class in high school and how much I enjoyed writing code and designing my own websites. From there it was not long before I had switched my major to computer science with a concentration in software engineering.
</p>
<p>
Throughout my time in the Computer Science program at SNHU I have worked hard to learn and develop skills to prepare myself for a career in software. While I learned many valuable concepts, there are few in particular that stand out and better showcase my strengths.

# Self Assesment
## Team Collaboration
<p>
	It is challenging to learn to write software, and even more challenging to learn to do so with others in a way that allows for a collaborative and productive environment for everyone. In CS 310 Team Collaboration; a class specific to the software engineering concentration, we learned skills to do just that. We learned how to use Git and GitHub to work as a team concurrently on the same piece of software. We learned to create separate branches to work on our own assigned parts of a central project and merge them together once they were complete and tested. We also learned specific skills related to working with others that I feel often do not get mentioned at the developer level. We learned the importance of balancing making sure everyoneâ€™s ideas are heard and being efficient and productive. Both the technical and personal skills were challenging to implement at times but having completed the course I now know I can use collaborative technologies like Git to work on software in a team with great success. I am also confident in my skills working with others in a professional and supportive environment. 
Communication to Stakeholders</p>

## Communication to Stakeholders
<p>
	Another set of skills which I learned in my degree that I feel stands out is the ability to communicate with the stakeholders of a software project. The business and communication side of software is as much a part of the process as the actual development, and having a good understanding of how this process works made a big difference for me as to how I felt about my understanding of software development and computer science as a whole. In this course we learned the Agile development process and undertook each different role within the process. As a product owner, we had to directly communicate with investors of our project. We learned how to relay information about the project to the stakeholders as it was being developed. Something that stood out to me was when the course dictated that the stakeholders request additional functionality of the project in the middle of development. This taught us how to adapt to a challenging situation which often occurs in the real world. As the product owner we had to plan these new improvements with the team, while also balancing what was possible or not possible based on what the stakeholders were asking for.
</p>
## Data structures and Algorithms
<p>
	When I reflect on things that I have learned, learning different data structures and algorithms stands out to me in value. I also found these concepts to be very interesting, and learning them, propelled me into an even deeper interest in the computer science field as a whole. I learned that having the right data structure is critical to being able to get the most value out of a project, and they are essential for developing software. Algorithms are equally as important to the value of software. I particularly found the efficiency of different algorithms with different applications to be interesting.  Most of this learning was done in CS-260 Data Structures and Algorithms course. In this course I gained experience working with and improving many types of algorithms and data structures. Some of these included vectors, hash tables, and tree structures for data structures as well as sort, search, and hashing algorithms. I learned that planning accordingly for a project by selecting the right data structure and algorithm is often times where developers have the most value. Understanding these concepts and applying them well is often the difference between software that works an software that is magnitudes better.
</p>
## Software Engineering and Databases
<p>
	Throughout my degree I learned many aspects of software development over a broad scope of courses. It is difficult to discuss everything as a whole because it is such a wide variety. I was introduced to basic programming concepts in CS-200 with Python as my introductory language, with Java being introduced next in IT 145 to solidify those basic concepts. I learned the importance of object-oriented design in IT-315 Object Oriented Analysis and Design, and the importance of testing in CS 320: Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance. I also learned to work with graphical applications using C++ in CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization, and to develop mobile applications in CS 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming.
</p>
<p>	
	In the broad scope of topics, I learned and worked with, databases were often a key component. I learned the basics of SQL and built a database in DAD 220: Introduction to SQL. In CS 340: Advanced Programming Concepts, we learned to use MongoDB to build NoSQL databases, and built on software engineering concepts learned in introductory courses. I also took DAT 220: Fundamentals of Data Mining, which focused more on the data aspect of databases rather than the design. I found this class the most interesting out of the other database courses because it showed how data mining can be used to extract immense value out of a collection of data.
</p>
## Security
<p>
	Another key lesson in most of the courses I took was that security should always be a major concern when developing software. There are a seemingly endless number of things that can go wrong security wise if a security mindset is not used. Buffer overflows, insecure input, or lack of proper authentication can all become major security issues which in some cases can lead to security breaches which impact millions of people. In CS 405: Secure Coding, we conducted a secure code audit on C++ source code for a utility company management software. The audit documented dozens of security vulnerabilities from String formatted output, memory management, pointer errors, and more. I learned the importance of using security analysis software tools in combination with detailed manual reviews. In CS 410: Reverse Software Engineering we disassembled binary files and were shown how this can make security vulnerabilities apparent. This highlighted the importance of having secure code, as reverse engineering can always be used to find vulnerabilities which are left in code.
