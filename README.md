## Introduction
It was certainly a long journey, but now that I am finished with my time at SNHU I can reflect on my growth, both as a software developer and modern and as a life-long learner. I originally began at SNHU as a criminal Justice major. After taking a few classes I began to realize that this career path was not for me. I had always had great interest in technology and growing up I spent a lot of time tinkering with anything I could get my hands on. I had drifted away from this interest in the first few years of my adult life but as I began to search for new career options my love of technology and computers came back. I thought back on taking an introduction to webpage design class in high school and how much I enjoyed writing code and designing my own websites. From there it was not long before I had switched my major to computer science with a concentration in software engineering.

Throughout my time in the Computer Science program at SNHU I have worked hard to learn and develop skills to prepare myself for a career in software. While I learned many valuable concepts, there are few in particular that stand out and better showcase my strengths.
