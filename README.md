## Introduction
<p>
It was certainly a long journey, but now that I am finished with my time at SNHU I can reflect on my growth, both as a software developer and modern and as a life-long learner. I originally began at SNHU as a criminal Justice major. After taking a few classes I began to realize that this career path was not for me. I had always had great interest in technology and growing up I spent a lot of time tinkering with anything I could get my hands on. I had drifted away from this interest in the first few years of my adult life but as I began to search for new career options my love of technology and computers came back. I thought back on taking an introduction to webpage design class in high school and how much I enjoyed writing code and designing my own websites. From there it was not long before I had switched my major to computer science with a concentration in software engineering.

<p>
Throughout my time in the Computer Science program at SNHU I have worked hard to learn and develop skills to prepare myself for a career in software. While I learned many valuable concepts, there are few in particular that stand out and better showcase my strengths.

## Self Assesment
## Team Collaboration
<p>
	It is challenging to learn to write software, and even more challenging to learn to do so with others in a way that allows for a collaborative and productive environment for everyone. In CS 310 Team Collaboration; a class specific to the software engineering concentration, we learned skills to do just that. We learned how to use Git and GitHub to work as a team concurrently on the same piece of software. We learned to create separate branches to work on our own assigned parts of a central project and merge them together once they were complete and tested. We also learned specific skills related to working with others that I feel often do not get mentioned at the developer level. We learned the importance of balancing making sure everyone’s ideas are heard and being efficient and productive. Both the technical and personal skills were challenging to implement at times but having completed the course I now know I can use collaborative technologies like Git to work on software in a team with great success. I am also confident in my skills working with others in a professional and supportive environment.
